well there's a mother standing there uh uh washing the dishes and the sink is overspilling
and uh the window's open
and outside the window there's a walk with a c curved walk with a garden
and you can see another uh uh building there
looks like a garage or something with curtains and the grass in the garden
and there are dishes uh uh two cups and a saucer on the sink
and uh she's getting her feet wet from the overflow of the water from the sink
she seems to be oblivious to the fact that the s sink is overflowing
she's also oblivious to the fact that her kids are stealing cookies out of the cookie jar
and the kid on the stool is gonna fall off the stool
he's standing up there in the cupboard taking cookies out of the jar, handing them to his uh a girl about the same age
the kids are somewhere around seven or eight years old or nine
and the mother is gonna get shocked when the when the he tumbles and the cookie jar comes down
and I think that's about all
somebody's getting cookies out of the cookie jar, standing on a stool
the stool's gonna tip over
and the girl's saying
shh don't let somebody hear
and the mother's drying dishes
the water's running out into the floor
cups and plates are sitting on the counter
ou you can look out the window and see the shrubbery
um the lid's sideways from the cookie jar
the door is open on the cabinet
um mother apparently doesn't really notice well enough
hm curtains are hanging on the window
the window is open
okay
there's a little boy and he's getting he's standing on a stool that's upsetting
and he's getting a cookie and he's sharing a cookie with the little girl who is shushing her mother with her finger and reaching for the cookie at the same time
on the k
what are what are the instructions
just give as many details like
action
or d or
oh okay
the cupboard door is open
the stool is crooked
the water is splashing on the floor
the m uh mother is um I'm assuming it's a mother is stepping in it
she's drying her dishes
the uh sink is overflowing
the cups and the saucers are there
the window is open and you see the lawn outside
and it must be summertime
they all have on shor short sleeves
and uh she's wearing an apron
okay
are you ready
um well the sink is overflowing
mother is standing in the water like a jerk
she's wiping the dishes also like a jerk
um there
his sister has her has her hand up finger up to her mouth like she's saying
shh
to be quiet
don't let mother know what you're doing
and he's about to hand her a cookie
but um in a few moments it's going to be like total catastrophe
mother the reason the water's flowing out over the sink is because the water is running furiously
um and I'm looking out through the window
and I don't see anything going on out there
unless m I don't
that's just a bush I'm presuming or a plum pudding
um I told you the stools about to go over
in a moment there's going to be real chaos which will make what's going on in the picture look like nothing
the cookie jar is full
the lid is off the cookie jar
and the
do you want me to tell you all of those things
the the cabinet door has just swung open
stool is about to fall
I guess I've just told you that
with a terrible crash
um mother is daydreaming
she doesn't even know what's going on behind her
I think that's very important and sometimes typical
um seems to be all I can see
okay
many dish or the mother's washing the dishes and the sink is overflowing
she has some of them uh dried already on the side as she's looking out the window while the little boy is falling off the stool because he's getting into the cookie jar to give to his little sister who's reaching up to get the cookie also
um there's water all over the floor
uh there's the garden is outside and the mother's not paying any attention to what they do
the stool is tipping
the cookie jar the um uh door is open
um there may be a little breeze coming in because the this window is open
um
shh t we won't tell mother while you give me the cookie
um
and uh the mother's stepping in the water and she's probably so engrossed in what she's doing outside she neither knows what the children are doing nor is she paying any attention that the water's overflowing
okay
mother is drying the dishes but the water is going out over the sink onto the floor
ah it's a pretty day outside
lots of flowers
there are three dishes left
she's standing in the water
looks dangerous
the children i are getting into the cookie jar
the boy's up there on the stool
and that's almost falling over
he's got one cookie in his hand
he's handing it to the little girl
and he's getting another one out of the cookie jar cupboard
did you say action that is going on
uh the little girl is kinda has her hand up to her mouth
looks like she's trying to eat it or be quiet or she's laughing

and she sort of a little bit bitchy
and the water's going flooding over the sink
and there's a saucer, there's a plate, there's a couple of dishes

a girl laughing at her brother who is taking cookies out of the cookie jar and he's ready to fall off the damn plat off the uh off the uh sh pl chair he's on
the chair's crooked
what the hell else
and then there's a plate, saucer and two cups
she's looking out the window
the window's open
she's not paying any attention to the kids
the water's flooding over the sink
what else you want
well uh the kids are are in the corner
um they're grading uh they they are going to um get uh uh uh some cookies from the cookie jar
and uh the mother does not see it because she's inside uh um drying the clothes
and uh the kids then just uh
and I guess in the the picture here that um the mother that's working hard and and the kids were were playing
and uh all of a sudden uh somebody s stepped in uh s uh turned over a dish
and uh all over the floor
except that it did did not dry it up
k it didn't um splash from the i it splashed from the sink but not from
no that's no that's no
I'm too too trying to get too much out of it
and one uh one one one of the kids is gonna get a t crack on the head
and maybe he has uh um
man
this is it's so
some of the sometimes I I see it very clear and and uh other times I I see uh r
, a weak image, so to speak
and sometimes I have I just have this
you're what what is in here now
but mostly uh is I I have uh not not so much trouble uh in I d it uh uh looking at a thing at it uh as um um um s um am an imarriage but not
uh but an etch you would say it in a little

okay
uh we see a uh a b little boy climbed up on a stool reaching for the cookie jar
and uh the stool is about to or is falling
uh he is trying to get a cookie for himself and also one for his sister
uh his sister is telling him to be very quiet
she's going
can't write that down
telling him to be quiet
and uh let's see
in the meantime uh the mother is washing the dishes or yes washing dishes and the sink has uh overflowed and uh is pouring water on the floor
I don't think I see anything else
okay
alright
I see the little boy stealing cookies from the cookie jar
and the little girl's uh he gave some to the little girl and she's eating some of the cookies
and I guess this is mama and she's washing the dishes
and she dropped a dish
no no she didn't drop a dish
uh the the water that she's washing the dishes with she let run
and it's overflown o overflown o o overflown
that doesn't that doesn't sound right
did it uh
we forgot to turn off the spigot
and so the water is running off into the onto the floor here
and mom apparently is washing the dishes
and here's this little boy stealing the cookie j cookies
he's gonna gonna fall because his uh the the cookies jar or the the the bench s the s four legged stool whatever it is is is gonna fall over with him
and mama's drying the dishes as usual for mamas
uh let's see now
I guess there's more things I'm sposta see
let's see here now
oh uh
mom apparently here, she forgot to turn off the water and the the water is spilling out over the f onto the floor onto the kitchen floor
and the little girl has pushed over the
uh I either he she pushed it over or he fell over with it
you know it uh I I uh excuse me but you know I I was
there's a little girl
and a little boy standing on top of a stool
and it looks like a mother maybe washing the dishes in the kitchen
there's cookies in the jar up in the pantry I suppose
there's a cup two cups and a saucer or a plate maybe
uh there's some shrubs outside
the uh the sink is overflowing right now
and that's about all
the sink is overflowing
the sink is overflowing
he's trying to kill himself
you want more
that's it
hm a lady a lady and her children
children
the lady is wash washing dishes
and
okay
yeah
the children have cookies
the father isn't coming
father didn't come in yet
and the lady is getting it ready
get
it's a water with that
water went down
it's gonna fall over
so she will find her
and the mother washes drying the dishes
and the stool's upset
you know she's getting on getting the cookies
there's up cup and saucer setting there on a plate ready to eat
the cookie jar right here
that's all I see
and th th this this is
well whoever's over there spilled it, knocked it down
I don't know what that is
looks like a mouse
mhm
mhm
oh I see a part of the whole kitchen
is that all the kitchen or isn't it
s uh oh I can't read
a lady a mother were in her kitchen
in her kitchen doing some work I suppose
and the uh s there's another woman there sharing their pleasures or whatever
oh have you have you checked heard of that new game that they started to play after christmas
did you
is a
well it looks like
I'd say this is
well let's see
it looks like
oh

my mother will beat me by my wife will beat me by a couple rows of this
that's that's like the washing would say washing machine
or let me see
I can't
oh that's the son come out of from school maybe or something
that's a youngster there
well that's just as though they
and right there he's uh same as back there except for down there in the bottom I think it's
uh that's a little
the little boy is up on uh on this thing here
and it's he's up trying to get something out of the garden selection I think it is
the little girl I think is mad because she didn't get some of it
and here's mama drying the dishes
no just the little girl and the boy was on here
the little girl and the boy
she's reaching up to the boy and the boy is got his other hand down
so
it looks color
no that's all
oh she spilled something I think
from the sink down
it came splashing down
that's the first I noticed it
I'm terrible anymore
uh well the children are climbing up and he's about to fall
and he's getting cookies
and she's uh telling him to be quiet so mother won't hear it won't hear him getting up there
and uh he's handing a cookie down to her
she's washing the dishes
and uh
whether she's up I can't believe she's upset about the kids because she hasn't seen them
maybe she did turn and look at them and then go back to the dishes
in other words it's uh
uh she she's deciding that if she did see them she's deciding that she's going to let them go ahead with it
but I don't think she would have let them go ahead if she saw the little boy falling
I think she would have turned
maybe dropped her dish
but she would have gotten hold of him and saved him from being harmed in the fall
and he might just pull all the cookie jar with him when he falls too
and with the water on the floor and the cookie jar on the floor it would be a sad
, threesome but and the kitchen would be a mess
oh yes
a little girl a and the little boy is getting cookies out of the jar
oh and the stool is upsetting
and the I guess it's the mother is drying dishes
water's spilling down all over the sink
water on the floor
little boy's gonna fall and that steps uh that there stool
uh I think the cookie jar is gonna fall
and the guess drying dishes and water the faucet's on and water's running all over the floor
wh what else am I sup I mean what what
yeah
the cookie jar
the stool
her doing the dishes
the water spilling
far as yeah that's as far as I could see
and I will tell you what's g
oh boy
well the little boy is reaching for a cookie
and his s stool is falling over
and the little girl is begging him to give her one
and she's pointing to her mouth
she wants to eat it
uh their mama is doing the dishes
the water's running over the sink
that's a mess
and then she's not even looking at them
drying dishes
I think she's looking out the window
it's a nice yard out there
two cups and and a dish finished
anything else
I see a tad bit
and somebody is doing drying dishes
no I can't no I can't get this very well, clear
well someone's standing on a stool and the stool is getting ready to fall over
it's mm well somebody's drying dishes
no I don't see anything else going on over here
I'm I'm thinking now maybe the water's r overrunning
I'm not too sure
there's some water on the floor here
and there's some in the sink that's overrunning

an average home that looks very much like ours at many times
and the mother is well she's spilling her water which is not very good but she's doing washing dishes and drying them
and one of the children upset the cookie jar
and that's an very average thing to go in in a home
our home is a very it's a very active family
and so that it makes it kinda hard at our house sometime because uh there's a lot of ac like I said a lot of activity
well the poor girl is spilling the water on her feet
it's gonna be k wet but then she'll hafta struggle with that
also there are a few more dishes left that didn't get finished
this hasta be the dishes
and how that little boy fell off that stool I don't know but he did
no
okay
uh there's a cook a b a boy's a boy is uh taking uh cookies and uh giving one to the girl imagine
and she wants one
I don't know
the uh mother's uh washing dishes
she spilled it
uh she's washing dishes
and uh
huh
alright
oh
uh oh he's gonna fall
and uh and she's laughing at them there
I don't know what else
I don't know
um t taking some cookies
and f falling over
and uh mother's drying dishes
and things falling uh um
sink's running over
and two cups and saucer on the plate uh on the sink
and uh
and the girl's um um

and um the spigot's on the sink
and uh
well that's about it
the boy's uh falling off the stool
the the girl's got her hand up
the lady's wa drying dishes
the water is spilling on the floor
faucet's on
the boy's trying to get a cookie jar out
l lid's off of it
sink's by the window
that's all I know
okay, I see a boy in the cookie jar
I see he has the lid off
I see that he is standing on a three legged stool and he's about to depart from that three legged stool
he has one cookie in his hand, handing it down to his sister and she's reaching up for it
and I think she's indicating to the boy to keep still so his mother doesn't hear what's going on
I see the mother
uh I guess she's drying the dishes and she's not paying attention because she's uh leaving the sink run over and it's spilling all over the floor
and she must not be conscious because she's standing in it and doesn't know it
um sh I think she must I think she's probably looking out the window as I take the second look
and I see apparently a couple dirty dishes on the table
I see the cupboards
uh I don't know whether they all have knobs on them or not
doesn't look like the two where the boy and the girl are have knobs on the cupboard door
and I see outside
I see uh apparently it's a tree, some shrubbery and some hedges
about it

oh and there's a girl here talking and a boy I assume on this side here
and this is a highchair here
and uh
I can't see what that is
oh there's another
did I talk about this girl up here
she's uh
I can't see too plain what she's doing
oh yes I think so
where was she
this girl
I really can't see what she's doing
no uh I don't
yeah, that's awfully hard for me to distinguish
oh it's the same picture
you should give me a different one
why
it would be more fun if you had some variety
okay
we have here a scene in a kitchen and it looks as though that's a mama who is working at the sink and her two children
and the two children are hoping that mama will not notice because she's looking out the window that they are getting into the cookie jar
so the boy climbs up on a stool to reach the cookie jar
and as he's getting up there the s the tool the stool is tilting and he looks as though he were about to fall over
and the little girl is telling him to be quiet by putting her finger on her lips
he has one cookie in his hand, is reaching for another one
the lid is off the cookie jar
the cupboard door is open
he's supposedly going to hand one cookie, it looks as though he is, to his sister and grab another one for himself but I doubt he's that he's gonna get all that done before the stool falls over
on the other around the corner of the kitchen uh um there's a counter that uh sort of turns a corner
there are cupboards below the counter and above the counter where the cookies are
then when you get over and have turned a corner in the kitchen you have base cabinets and then you have a window above that which is looking out into something which makes it looks as though it's summer outside because the window is open
there are things growing out there
there's a walk
there's uh uh some shrubbery underneath another window that looks it's in a another wing of the house
there's a tree beyond
there are tie back curtains at the window
the mother is working at the sink and the faucet is left on and apparently there's no overflow in the sink so it's overflowing right onto the floor
and uh she has on a sleeveless dress which also indicates that it's summer
and it looks though she has an apron on
she has short hair
um she is drying a dish with a tea towel a plate with a tea towel
um beside the sink there are two cups and a plate
looks as though there's some suds and some dishes in the sink
and two faucets with type handles one on either side and a center faucet
she has shoes on with no ties, just sort of slip
there's a little scallop valance across the top of the curtains
hm
well the handles on the door are the kind that are just um almost like a round piece of wood that you hafta get a hold of to pull the cupboard door open
and what's really strange is that you can't see any handles on the cupboards on the other side of the kitchen
the pearl mo mom's getting her wet feet wet because she thinking of days gone by and then the water run
and uh that boy whether he knows or not he's gonna crack his head on the back of that counter trying to get too many cookies out
he
unless that's the way all silly girls act at that age
pardon
oh sure
there's no handles on the uh the cabinet drawers under the counter on his on the left side
and uh over in the the window you see through the kitchen window all the styles are not in the glass
and if the kitchen window's the same type of window as well the other part of the house the style's only in the
maybe they build them that way
no, but I did n I did notice that's a little I wouldn't say unusual but uh but
pardon
I said that the sink was overflowing
the mother's wet getting her feet wet
the boy's going to fall very hard and hurt himself
and nobody's gonna help him
well happening
did I say the cabinet doors where the kids are have no handles on them
oh there's got to be a dozen other things
responsible
well I'll tell you the way mom is looking there's not much going on in her head
she's thinking of dad
and the little girl is saying
don't tell mom
the conflict's in whereas the what she's thinking whereas she didn't know the kids are behind her
and did I say

the cabinet doors aren't the same are different sizes
have no handles
I guess you take a big sledge hammer to that
well the uh the little boy is
he's uh partially gonna fall off the stool
his sister is telling him to be quiet
the mother is washing dishes
and uh the water is overflowing onto the floor and she's standing in a puddle and
well the sink is running over
she's drying the dishes
they're getting in the cookie jar and they're upsetting the stool
the girl is reaching for a cookie
the lady here's standing right in the water
she seems to be looking out the window at the lawn
that's about it right
I s see this woman who's standing by the sink washing dishes and the water's spilling out over the sink
and I see a little this little boy standing on a stool reaching for cookies and he looks like he's ready to fall
uh as far as action goes I don't know if I see any more action in there at all
it's a family affair, a mother and the children
and uh they're each busy at at uh something
and the um
but they seem happy in doing their own thing
I don't think I I lost that
I think I
well the little girl is reaching for a cookie
and the boy is on a stool which is falling over to get in the cookie jar up on the second shelf of the cupboard with the door open
the faucet is running and it's overflowing onto the floor because um it's overflowing into the sink
the woman is drying a plate
she's also looking out the window
there's a couple of bowls and a plate on the uh counter
curtains at the windows
there's a driveway or it looks like a driveway outside
and you can see another window and some bushes out there and the tree
and I guess that's pa looks like a part of the garage window of the garage out there
and uh um the cookie jar has the lid off
and the boy has one hand in the cookie jar and one with a cookie in it handing uh to the little girl who's got her hand up for it and her she looks like got her finger to mouth tell him to be careful
a little boy is getting himself some cookies out of the jar
and the s stool is turning over on him
he's handing the little girl some cookies out of the jar
is that it
and well that's in the first one
he's handing the little girl cookies out of the cookie jar
and he's on a stool and it's turning over
and he's handing her some cookies
and in the second picture the little girl uh looks as though she's drying dishes
and uh oh let me think the sink is running over on the floor
she has the spigots on
a nice view from the window
is that is that it
that's it
I see a little boy on a stool almost falling over, taking cookies out of the cookie jar
and the little girl is putting her finger to her mouth that she's uh to keep it quiet
the uh mother is washing dishes
she's drying the dishes and letting the water
and then water is running over and she is standing in the sink in the water that's uh running over
uh there's a window there she's looking at, at the grass and the flowers
and the uh uh curtains seem to be shaking from the
the dishes that she's through
and the little girl's raising her hands for the little boy to hand her a cookie
and he has one cookie in his hand and he's going after another one
uh he's ready to hand her a cookie
mother is uh holding a dish cloth that she's drying the dishes with
she has a platter that she's drying
I don't see any other action
uh the sink's running over
the water's going all over the floor
here the boy the step
and she's begging for cookies the girl is
coming back to the sink let's see here
aw mama's stepping in the water
and I s I said the sink was running over
she's drying dishes
wait a minute
what the devil is
there is something but I don't know what it is written on the grass it seems
what is that
and
that's a something there
hm let's see
I don't see anything else there
she's stepping in the water
the sink's running over
that spells something down there but I can't see it
so far
and he's on a a stool that's gonna fall over while they're stealing cookies
and there's a plate and two cups on the sink and she's got a plate in her hand
I don't see anything else
whew
uh do I hafta use my my uh my personal uh description
or like uh
the c cookie jar stealing the g uh cookie out of the cookie jar
the t uh the tripar not t stool the tr triple stool is he's uh he's rocking with its
uh I wonder if she's putting her finger to her her lips
and uh is that she wants one to eat or she's ha h reaching up for it
huh
and then spilling the water in the kitchen sink
she's drying the dishes
they got their s sink is overflowing

that's a good way to break his neck
break his back I shoulda said
woman left her faucet running and it rolled over the floor
that's bad enough for me to do
um let me scan it a little bit more
uh oh it's there more in time

I'm going to hafta quit reading this because this this is shining on this
getting my


this this string is not on this is it
yes
they're reaching up for a cookie in cookie jar
and they're cooking a turkey dinner I guess
cooking a turkey dinner
she's doing the dishes
this little boy might fall off of that stool he's on
and the water's splashing out all over the floor and she doesn't know it
and the boy might he's looking for the cookie jar and he might bang his head on the
uh the boy is reaching into the cookie jar
he's falling off the stool
the little girl is reaching for a cookie
mother is drying the dishes
the sink is running over
mother's getting her feet wet
they all have shoes on
there's a cup two cups and a saucer on the sink
the window has draw withdrawn drapes
you look out on the driveway
there's kitchen cabinets
oh what's happening
mother is looking out the window
the girl is touching her lips
the boy is standing on his right foot
his left foot is sort of up in the air
mother's right foot is flat on the floor and her left she's on her left toe
uh she's holding the dish cloth in her right hand and the plate she is drying in her left
I think I've run out of
yeah
young boy is up at the cookie jar
he has the cookie jar opened
he's reaching for one for himself
he's handing one down to his sister
the three legged stool is coming down with him
uh they're nicely dressed kids but uh the boy needs his socks pulled up
mm that's all I see there
mother I presume it's mother is at the sink
the water is r running over out of sink
she's drying a dish
she's looking out the window
there are two cups and a dish, I presume that's a dish, that are already dry I guess and sitting on the side of the sink
uh nicely groomed
nice curtains pulled back
it's apparently summer outside because the window's open and it looks like shrubs are growing
you can see a window in the other part of the house
I presume that's still their house
and there's a driveway bordered with grass
and there's a tree out there somewhere that you can see part of the trunk and part of the foliage
and uh I see cabinets around the kitchen, other cabinets
and that's about it
oh little boy's in the cookie jar
the girl's standing down and waiting for him to give him some give her some
the mother's doing the dishes
and she's also letting him letting hm
oh the water just fell off over on the floor
uh can I turn the page
okay
that's all there is except she's just getting all wet
no
the little girl was helping the boy to get to the cookie jar
but he started stumbling
he must have fell over because he seems to be falling there
and the mother's over at the sink drying dishes
and it's going on the floor
and three cups three bowls there
mhm
the little boy is reaching for a cookie
and he's falling at the same time because the stool has tipped over
his little sister is reaching for a cookie and I think beginning to laugh because he's falling
the sink is running over and dripping water on the floor while the mother is trying to dry the dishes
um the window is open and the curtains are blowing in the breeze coming in from outside
the water is running in the sink
that's why it's overflowing
I also believe that the mother is daydreaming
possibly worrying about uh something
that's it
that's all I see
hm
it's a little boy climbing up getting some coo cookies out of the cookie jar
and his little sister reaching for some
and the little boy is standing on a ladder
and his big sister washing the dishes at the sink
big sister washing the dishes and then she got she got uh dishes on the s sitting on the sink

he he he he's passing it down to her
and the ladder the ladder about to turn over

it's tilty
uh the mother is doing the dishes
and unfortunately the sink is overflowing on the floor
it's wet


the little b

I thought there was something around the little boy's foot or at least at least just one part of one foot foot
the little girl I I don't whether she's laughing or asking for the cookie or saying “shh” so mother doesn't hear them
um the girl's in the
hm did I get that
and girl that
she's gushing dishes
and there's two boys
one uh one is get a choc cookies cookies jar in the cabinet
and the the girl's crying for the s she wants a coo cook c cookie
and the girl
what's it always say that
upset the water up the sink
mhm
hm well sh she's um spilling the water from from washing uh her dishes
it's it's running over rather
in the
and in the meantime he's tilting his chair
hm
he is he's he's trying to get the cake down where sh sh I suppose she can share with him
and then and the mother is uh lis the water is running over which she doesn't seem to be aware of it too much
and his chair is slipping out from uh the stool is slipping out from under him
all the action
okay it's a boy and a girl
and uh well this here one g one one they're falling falling down in through here
and then this here when the w the water in it should be going down in there but it's going down on the side here
it's going all the way down in there
um they're getting something to eat here

and they're getting something to eat here
and this is a nice place what they what they what they have
but they put that stuff around in there

and then here when they had some stuff in through here
and uh
I like these things in through here too
yeah
okay the kid on the bench who's got his hand in the cookie jar and he's falling off and his sister wants one
uh his mother is standing in a puddle of water because she didn't turn off the faucet and she's drying dry a dish
she oughta dry her feet instead
uh the window is open
um uh well the sink is overflowing
uh it's obviously summer because the window as I said was open
there's uh supposedly leaves on the trees
uh anything else that I'm sposta pick up
well the kid's gonna fall off
and it
the lid is off the cookie jar
and he's got one in his hand and handing it to his sister
and one and he's sneaking another one
not sneaking
uh the water is still running in the sink
and splashing on the floor
well the mother has water spilling all over the floor for one thing
then she's starting to dry the dishes
and then she's looking out the window
and uh the little girl's there and the little boy and he almost is falling off the stool
but he didn't so
he d he survived anyway huh
yeah yeah on this paper yeah

and sh she's standing there
it's falling on the floor
the child is got a stool and reaching up into the cookie jar
and the the the stool is tipping over
and he's sorta put down the plates
and she's reaching up to get it but I don't see anything wrong with her though
yeah that's it
I can't see anything
well let's see
the girl is whispering to be quiet because mother might find out that the he's is standing on a school stool which is bending over
and he's reaching in a cookie jar and he has a cookie
and she's grabbing for the one that he has in his left hand
and the sink is running over with water for some reason or other while she's drying
and the race horse is jumping through the window
no
okay
anywhere
um the little girl's laughing
the little boy's getting cookies and he's falling
uh I guess the mother would be doing dishes and the water's overflowing out of the sink
uh the window's open and I would say the wind is blowing
I guess that's it
you mean like the woman doing the dishes and the water running out of the in the sink
little boy is getting in the cookie jar
the s is falling over
little girl wants one
hmhunh no
the dishes sitting on the sink
and the window
the grass and stuff outside
the woman has an apron on
I don't know where everything
I don't see anything else on that
there's um the two children are in the process of stealing cookies from the cookie jar
and the little girl has her finger up to her mouth to be quiet
and the stool on which the boy is standing is about to fall
and the mother must be looking out the window because the sink is spilling over with water, overflowing with water
and the meanwhile she's drying the dishes
and the water is falling down onto the floor
and it's a nice day
the window's up it looks like
and it's a nice day outside
that's about all I can see on that
seeing the mother
she's washing dishes and the water's running all over the floor
and the boy he's reaching up for cookies
and he his ladder slipped from underneath him
and I guess he's gonna have an accident
and the little girl she's waiting for the cookies, but I don't think she's gonna to get them because the boy's falling down
well the boy is getting cookies and he's gonna fall off the stool
and the mother is doing dishes
and the water is running over out of the sink
she has the faucet on
she's spilling water all over the floor
well the boy is handing the little girl a cookie

okay the boy the boy is standing on a ch chair that is uh starting to fall over

standing on a stool which is tipping over
the little girl's got her hand up for one
and I don't know what the hand means to the mouth
does it mean she wants to eat
the kitchen sink is running over, the water running out on the floor

uh hm two cups on the counter, a plate
the mother's standing in the middle of the water
curtains at the windows

and she has uh her hairdo

how many things are sposta be wrong
yeah I see the woman's in a kitchen
and
, now it looks like she's ... 9035 12555
I me I c I can't really pick it out but
oh and there's a girl here talking and a boy I assume on this side here
and this is a highchair here
and uh
I can't see what that is
oh there's another
did I talk about this girl up here
she's uh
I can't see too plain what she's doing
oh yes I think so
where was she
this girl
I really can't see what she's doing
no uh I don't
yeah, that's awfully hard for me to distinguish
oh it's the same picture
you should give me a different one
why
it would be more fun if you had some variety
okay
we have here a scene in a kitchen and it looks as though that's a mama who is working at the sink and her two children
and the two children are hoping that mama will not notice because she's looking out the window that they are getting into the cookie jar
so the boy climbs up on a stool to reach the cookie jar
and as he's getting up there the s the tool the stool is tilting and he looks as though he were about to fall over
and the little girl is telling him to be quiet by putting her finger on her lips
he has one cookie in his hand, is reaching for another one
the lid is off the cookie jar
the cupboard door is open
he's supposedly going to hand one cookie, it looks as though he is, to his sister and grab another one for himself but I doubt he's that he's gonna get all that done before the stool falls over
on the other around the corner of the kitchen uh um there's a counter that uh sort of turns a corner
there are cupboards below the counter and above the counter where the cookies are
then when you get over and have turned a corner in the kitchen you have base cabinets and then you have a window above that which is looking out into something which makes it looks as though it's summer outside because the window is open
there are things growing out there
there's a walk
there's uh uh some shrubbery underneath another window that looks it's in a another wing of the house
there's a tree beyond
there are tie back curtains at the window
the mother is working at the sink and the faucet is left on and apparently there's no overflow in the sink so it's overflowing right onto the floor
and uh she has on a sleeveless dress which also indicates that it's summer
and it looks though she has an apron on
she has short hair
um she is drying a dish with a tea towel a plate with a tea towel
um beside the sink there are two cups and a plate
looks as though there's some suds and some dishes in the sink
and two faucets with type handles one on either side and a center faucet
she has shoes on with no ties, just sort of slip
there's a little scallop valance across the top of the curtains
hm
well the handles on the door are the kind that are just um almost like a round piece of wood that you hafta get a hold of to pull the cupboard door open
and what's really strange is that you can't see any handles on the cupboards on the other side of the kitchen
the pearl mo mom's getting her wet feet wet because she thinking of days gone by and then the water run
and uh that boy whether he knows or not he's gonna crack his head on the back of that counter trying to get too many cookies out
he
unless that's the way all silly girls act at that age
pardon
oh sure
there's no handles on the uh the cabinet drawers under the counter on his on the left side
and uh over in the the window you see through the kitchen window all the styles are not in the glass
and if the kitchen window's the same type of window as well the other part of the house the style's only in the
maybe they build them that way
no, but I did n I did notice that's a little I wouldn't say unusual but uh but
pardon
I said that the sink was overflowing
the mother's wet getting her feet wet
the boy's going to fall very hard and hurt himself
and nobody's gonna help him
well happening
did I say the cabinet doors where the kids are have no handles on them
oh there's got to be a dozen other things
responsible
well I'll tell you the way mom is looking there's not much going on in her head
she's thinking of dad
and the little girl is saying
don't tell mom
the conflict's in whereas the what she's thinking whereas she didn't know the kids are behind her
and did I say

the cabinet doors aren't the same are different sizes
have no handles
I guess you take a big sledge hammer to that
well the uh the little boy is
he's uh partially gonna fall off the stool
his sister is telling him to be quiet
the mother is washing dishes
and uh the water is overflowing onto the floor and she's standing in a puddle and
well the sink is running over
she's drying the dishes
they're getting in the cookie jar and they're upsetting the stool
the girl is reaching for a cookie
the lady here's standing right in the water
she seems to be looking out the window at the lawn
that's about it right
I s see this woman who's standing by the sink washing dishes and the water's spilling out over the sink
and I see a little this little boy standing on a stool reaching for cookies and he looks like he's ready to fall
uh as far as action goes I don't know if I see any more action in there at all
it's a family affair, a mother and the children
and uh they're each busy at at uh something
and the um
but they seem happy in doing their own thing
I don't think I I lost that
I think I
well the little girl is reaching for a cookie
and the boy is on a stool which is falling over to get in the cookie jar up on the second shelf of the cupboard with the door open
the faucet is running and it's overflowing onto the floor because um it's overflowing into the sink
the woman is drying a plate
she's also looking out the window
there's a couple of bowls and a plate on the uh counter
curtains at the windows
there's a driveway or it looks like a driveway outside
and you can see another window and some bushes out there and the tree
and I guess that's pa looks like a part of the garage window of the garage out there
and uh um the cookie jar has the lid off
and the boy has one hand in the cookie jar and one with a cookie in it handing uh to the little girl who's got her hand up for it and her she looks like got her finger to mouth tell him to be careful
a little boy is getting himself some cookies out of the jar
and the s stool is turning over on him
he's handing the little girl some cookies out of the jar
is that it
and well that's in the first one
he's handing the little girl cookies out of the cookie jar
and he's on a stool and it's turning over
and he's handing her some cookies
and in the second picture the little girl uh looks as though she's drying dishes
and uh oh let me think the sink is running over on the floor
she has the spigots on
a nice view from the window

I see a little boy on a stool almost falling over, taking cookies out of the cookie jar
and the little girl is putting her finger to her mouth that she's uh to keep it quiet
the uh mother is washing dishes
she's drying the dishes and letting the water
and then water is running over and she is standing in the sink in the water that's uh running over

and the uh uh curtains seem to be shaking from the
the dishes that she's through
and the little girl's raising her hands for the little boy to hand her a cookie
and he has one cookie in his hand and he's going after another one
uh he's ready to hand her a cookie

mm that's all I see there
mother I presume it's mother is at the sink
the water is r running over out of sink
she's drying a dish
she's looking out the window
there are two cups and a dish, I presume that's a dish, that are already dry I guess and sitting on the side of the sink
uh nicely groomed
nice curtains pulled back
it's apparently summer outside because the window's open and it looks like shrubs are growing
you can see a window in the other part of the house
I presume that's still their house
and there's a driveway bordered with grass
and there's a tree out there somewhere that you can see part of the trunk and part of the foliage
and uh I see cabinets around the kitchen, other cabinets
and that's about it
oh little boy's in the cookie jar

the little boy is reaching for a cookie
and he's falling at the same time because the stool has tipped over
his little sister is reaching for a cookie and I think beginning to laugh because he's falling
the sink is running over and dripping water on the floor while the mother is trying to dry the dishes
um the window is open and the curtains are blowing in the breeze coming in from outside
the water is running in the sink
that's why it's overflowing
I also believe that the mother is daydreaming
possibly worrying about uh something

and his little sister reaching for some
and the little boy is standing on a ladder

the girl is whispering to be quiet because mother might find out that the he's is standing on a school stool which is bending over
and he's reaching in a cookie jar and he has a cookie
and she's grabbing for the one that he has in his left hand
and the sink is running over with water for some reason or other while she's drying
and the race horse is jumping through the window
no
okay
anywhere
um the little girl's laughing
the little boy's getting cookies and he's falling

uh the window's open and I would say the wind is blowing
I guess that's it
you mean like the woman doing the dishes and the water running out of the in the sink
little boy is getting in the cookie jar
the s is falling over
little girl wants one
hmhunh no
the dishes sitting on the sink

there's um the two children are in the process of stealing cookies from the cookie jar
and the little girl has her finger up to her mouth to be quiet
and the stool on which the boy is standing is about to fall
and the mother must be looking out the window because the sink is spilling over with water, overflowing with water
and the meanwhile she's drying the dishes
and the water is falling down onto the floor
and it's a nice day
the window's up it looks like
and it's a nice day outside
that's about all I can see on that
seeing the mother
she's washing dishes and the water's running all over the floor
and the boy he's reaching up for cookies
and he his ladder slipped from underneath him
and I guess he's gonna have an accident
and the little girl she's waiting for the cookies, but I don't think she's gonna to get them because the boy's falling down
well the boy is getting cookies and he's gonna fall off the stool
and the mother is doing dishes

she has the faucet on
she's spilling water all over the floor
