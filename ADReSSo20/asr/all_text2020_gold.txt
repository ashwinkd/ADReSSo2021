looks like a garage or something with curtains and the grass in the garden
and there are dishes uh uh two cups and a saucer on the sink
and uh she 's getting her feet wet from the overflow of the water from the sink
she seems to be oblivious to the fact that the s sink is overflowing
she 's also oblivious to the fact that her kids are stealing cookies out of the cookie jar
and the kid on the stool is gonna fall off the stool
he 's standing up there in the cupboard taking cookies out of the jar, handing them to his uh a girl about the same age
the kids are somewhere around seven or eight years old or nine
and the mother is gonna get shocked when the when the he tumbles and the cookie jar comes down
and i think that 's about all
somebody 's getting cookies out of the cookie jar, standing on a stool
the stool 's gonna tip over
and the girl 's saying
shh do n't let somebody hear
and the mother 's drying dishes
the water 's running out into the floor
cups and plates are sitting on the counter
ou you can look out the window and see the shrubbery
um the lid 's sideways from the cookie jar
the door is open on the cabinet
um mother apparently does n't really notice well enough
hm curtains are hanging on the window
the window is open
okay

to be quiet
do n't let mother know what you 're doing
and he 's about to hand her a cookie
but um in a few moments it 's going to be like total catastrophe
mother the reason the water 's flowing out over the sink is because the water is running furiously
um and i 'm looking out through the window
and i do n't see anything going on out there
unless m i do n't /
that 's just a bush i 'm presuming or a plum pudding
um i told you the stools about to go over

do you want me to tell you all of those things
the the cabinet door has just swung open
stool is about to fall
i guess i 've just told you that
with a terrible crash

um seems to be all i can see
okay
many dish or the mother 's washing the dishes and the sink is overflowing
she has some of them uh dried already on the side as she 's looking out the window while the little boy is falling off the stool because he 's getting into the cookie jar to give to his little sister who 's reaching up to get the cookie also

shh t we wo n't tell mother while you give me the cookie
um it 's in the kitchen of course and uh the cups two cups and a dish already have been dried

uh that 's a little
the little boy is up on uh on this thing here
and it 's he 's up trying to get something out of the garden selection i think it is
the little girl i think is mad because she did n't get some of it
and here 's mama drying the dishes
no just the little girl and the boy was on here
the little girl and the boy
she 's reaching up to the boy and the boy is got his other hand down
so [ exc] 50222 50774

from the sink down
it came splashing down
that 's the first i noticed it
i 'm terrible anymore
uh well the children are climbing up and he 's about to fall
and he 's getting cookies
and she 's uh telling him to be quiet so mother wo n't hear it wo n't hear him getting up there
and uh he 's handing a cookie down to her
she 's washing the dishes
and uh for some reason she must have been upset about something because uh she is letting the water run out all over the place
whether she 's up i ca n't believe she 's upset about the kids because she has n't seen them
maybe she did turn and look at them and then go back to the dishes
in other words it 's uh 42360 47800
uh she she 's deciding that if she did see them she 's deciding that she 's going to let them go ahead with it
but i do n't think she would have let them go ahead if she saw the little boy falling
i think she would have turned
maybe dropped her dish
but she would have gotten hold of him and saved him from being harmed in the fall
and he might just pull all the cookie jar with him when he falls too
and with the water on the floor and the cookie jar on the floor it would be a sad
, threesome but and the kitchen would be a mess
oh yes
a little girl a and the little boy is getting cookies out of the jar
oh and the stool is upsetting
and the i guess it 's the mother is drying dishes
water 's spilling down all over the sink
water on the floor
