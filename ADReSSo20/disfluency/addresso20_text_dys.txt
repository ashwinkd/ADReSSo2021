well _ there _ 's _ a _ mother _ standing _ there _ uh _ uh _ washing _ the _ dishes _ and _ the _ sink _ is _ overspilling _
and _ uh _ the _ window _ 's _ open _
and _ outside _ the _ window _ there _ 's _ a _ walk _ with _ a _ c _ curved _ walk _ with _ a _ garden _
and _ you _ can _ see _ another _ uh _ uh _ building _ there _
looks _ like _ a _ garage _ or _ something _ with _ curtains _ and _ the _ grass _ in _ the _ garden _
and _ there _ are _ dishes E uh _ uh _ two _ cups _ and _ a _ saucer _ on _ the _ sink _
and _ uh _ she _ 's _ getting _ her _ feet _ wet _ from _ the _ overflow _ of _ the _ water _ from _ the _ sink _
she _ seems _ to _ be _ oblivious _ to _ the _ fact _ that _ the _ s _ sink _ is _ overflowing _
she _ 's _ also _ oblivious _ to _ the _ fact _ that _ her _ kids _ are _ stealing _ cookies _ out _ of _ the _ cookie _ jar _
and _ the _ kid _ on _ the _ stool _ is _ gonna _ fall _ off _ the _ stool _
he _ 's _ standing _ up _ there _ in _ the _ cupboard _ taking _ cookies _ out _ of _ the _ jar _ handing _ them _ to _ his E uh _ a _ girl _ about _ the _ same _ age _
the _ kids _ are _ somewhere _ around _ seven _ or _ eight _ years _ old _ or _ nine _
and _ the _ mother _ is _ gonna _ get _ shocked _ when E the E when _ the E he _ tumbles _ and _ the _ cookie _ jar _ comes _ down _
and _ i _ think _ that _ 's _ about _ all _
somebody _ 's _ getting _ cookies _ out _ of _ the _ cookie _ jar _ standing _ on _ a _ stool _
the _ stool _ 's _ gonna _ tip _ over _
and _ the _ girl _ 's _ saying _
shh _ do _ n't _ let _ somebody _ hear _
and _ the _ mother _ 's _ drying _ dishes _
the _ water _ 's _ running _ out _ into _ the _ floor _
cups _ and _ plates _ are _ sitting _ on _ the _ counter _
ou _ you _ can _ look _ out _ the _ window _ and _ see _ the _ shrubbery _
um _ the _ lid _ 's _ sideways _ from _ the _ cookie _ jar _
the _ door _ is _ open _ on _ the _ cabinet _
um _ mother _ apparently _ does _ n't _ really _ notice _ well _ enough _
hm _ curtains _ are _ hanging _ on _ the _ window _
the _ window _ is _ open _
okay _
there _ 's _ a _ little _ boy _ and _ he E 's E getting E he _ 's _ standing _ on _ a _ stool _ that _ 's _ upsetting _
and E he E 's E getting E a E cookie E and _ he _ 's _ sharing _ a _ cookie _ with _ the _ little _ girl _ who _ is _ shushing _ her _ mother _ with _ her _ finger _ and _ reaching _ for _ the _ cookie _ at _ the _ same _ time _
on _ the _ k _
what E are E what _ are _ the _ instructions _
just _ give _ as _ many _ details _ like _
action _
or _ d _ or _
oh _ okay _
the _ cupboard _ door _ is _ open _
the _ stool _ is _ crooked _
the _ water _ is _ splashing _ on _ the _ floor _
the E m E uh E mother E is E um _ i _ 'm _ assuming _ it E 's E a _ mother _ is _ stepping _ in _ it _
she _ 's _ drying _ her _ dishes _
the _ uh _ sink _ is _ overflowing _
the _ cups _ and _ the _ saucers _ are _ there _
the _ window _ is _ open _ and _ you _ see _ the _ lawn _ outside _
and _ it _ must _ be _ summertime _
they _ all _ have _ on _ shor E short _ sleeves _
and _ uh _ she _ 's _ wearing _ an _ apron _
okay _
are _ you _ ready _
um _ well _ the _ sink _ is _ overflowing _
mother _ is _ standing _ in _ the _ water _ like _ a _ jerk _
she _ 's _ wiping _ the _ dishes _ also _ like _ a _ jerk _
um _ there _
his _ sister _ has E her E has _ her _ hand _ up _ finger _ up _ to _ her _ mouth _ like _ she _ 's _ saying _
shh _
to _ be _ quiet _
do _ n't _ let _ mother _ know _ what _ you _ 're _ doing _
and _ he _ 's _ about _ to _ hand _ her _ a _ cookie _
but _ um _ in _ a _ few _ moments _ it _ 's _ going _ to _ be _ like _ total _ catastrophe _
mother _ the _ reason _ the _ water _ 's _ flowing _ out _ over _ the _ sink _ is _ because _ the _ water _ is _ running _ furiously _
um _ and _ i _ 'm _ looking _ out _ through _ the _ window _
and _ i _ do _ n't _ see _ anything _ going _ on _ out _ there _
unless _ m E i _ do _ n't _
that _ 's _ just _ a _ bush _ i _ 'm _ presuming _ or _ a _ plum _ pudding _
um _ i _ told _ you _ the _ stools _ about _ to _ go _ over _
in _ a _ moment _ there _ 's _ going _ to _ be _ real _ chaos _ which _ will _ make _ what _ 's _ going _ on _ in _ the _ picture _ look _ like _ nothing _
the _ cookie _ jar _ is _ full _
the _ lid _ is _ off _ the _ cookie _ jar _
and _ the _
do _ you _ want _ me _ to _ tell _ you _ all _ of _ those _ things _
the E the _ cabinet _ door _ has _ just _ swung _ open _
stool _ is _ about _ to _ fall _
i _ guess _ i _ 've _ just _ told _ you _ that _
with _ a _ terrible _ crash _
um _ mother _ is _ daydreaming _
she _ does _ n't _ even _ know _ what _ 's _ going _ on _ behind _ her _
i _ think _ that _ 's _ very _ important _ and _ sometimes _ typical _
um _ seems _ to _ be _ all _ i _ can _ see _
okay _
many _ dish _ or _ the _ mother _ 's _ washing _ the _ dishes _ and _ the _ sink _ is _ overflowing _
she _ has _ some _ of _ them _ uh _ dried _ already _ on _ the _ side _ as _ she _ 's _ looking _ out _ the _ window _ while _ the _ little _ boy _ is _ falling _ off _ the _ stool _ because _ he _ 's _ getting _ into _ the _ cookie _ jar _ to _ give _ to _ his _ little _ sister _ who _ 's _ reaching _ up _ to _ get _ the _ cookie _ also _

and _ mama _ 's _ drying _ the _ dishes _ as _ usual _ for _ mamas _
uh _ let _ 's _ see _ now _
i _ guess _ there _ 's _ more _ things _ i _ 'm _ sposta _ see _
let _ 's _ see _ here _ now _
oh _ uh _
mom _ apparently _ here _ she _ forgot _ to _ turn _ off _ the _ water _ and _ the E the _ water _ is _ spilling _ out _ over _ the _ f _ onto E the E floor E onto _ the _ kitchen _ floor _
and _ the _ little _ girl _ has _ pushed _ over _ the _
uh _ i _ either _ he E she _ pushed _ it _ over _ or _ he _ fell _ over _ with _ it _
you _ know _ it E uh _ i _ i _ uh _ excuse _ me _ but _ you _ know _ i E i _ was _
there _ 's _ a _ little _ girl _
and _ a _ little _ boy _ standing _ on _ top _ of _ a _ stool _
and _ it _ looks _ like _ a _ mother _ maybe _ washing _ the _ dishes _ in _ the _ kitchen _
there _ 's _ cookies _ in _ the _ jar _ up _ in _ the _ pantry _ i _ suppose _
there _ 's _ a _ cup _ two _ cups _ and _ a _ saucer _ or _ a _ plate _ maybe _
uh _ there _ 's _ some _ shrubs _ outside _
the E uh _ the _ sink _ is _ overflowing _ right _ now _
and _ that _ 's _ about _ all _
the _ sink _ is _ overflowing _
the _ sink _ is _ overflowing _
he _ 's _ trying _ to _ kill _ himself _
you _ want _ more _
that _ 's _ it _
hm _ a E lady E a _ lady _ and _ her _ children _
children _
the _ lady _ is _ wash E washing _ dishes _
and _
okay _
yeah _
the _ children _ have _ cookies _
the _ father _ is _ n't _ coming _
father _ did _ n't _ come _ in _ yet _
and _ the _ lady _ is _ getting _ it _ ready _
get _
it _ 's _ a _ water _ with _ that _
water _ went _ down _
it _ 's _ gonna _ fall _ over _
so _ she _ will _ find _ her _
and _ the _ mother _ washes _ drying _ the _ dishes _
and _ the _ stool _ 's _ upset _
you _ know _ she _ 's _ getting E on E getting _ the _ cookies _
there _ 's _ up _ cup _ and _ saucer _ setting _ there _ on _ a _ plate _ ready _ to _ eat _
the _ cookie _ jar _ right _ here _
that _ 's _ all _ i _ see _
and _ th _ th _ this E this _ is _
well _ whoever _ 's _ over _ there _ spilled _ it _ knocked _ it _ down _
i _ do _ n't _ know _ what _ that _ is _
looks _ like _ a _ mouse _
mhm _
mhm _
oh _ i _ see _ a _ part _ of _ the _ whole _ kitchen _
is _ that _ all _ the _ kitchen _ or _ is _ n't _ it _
s _ uh _ oh _ i _ ca _ n't _ read _
a E lady E a _ mother _ were _ in _ her _ kitchen _
in _ her _ kitchen _ doing _ some _ work _ i _ suppose _
and _ the E uh E s E there _ 's _ another _ woman _ there _ sharing _ their _ pleasures _ or _ whatever _
oh _ have E you E have _ you _ checked E heard _ of _ that _ new _ game _ that _ they _ started _ to _ play _ after _ christmas _
did _ you _
is _ a _
well _ it _ looks _ like _
i _ 'd _ say _ this _ is _
well _ let _ 's _ see _
it _ looks _ like _
oh _
my E mother E will E beat E me E by E my _ wife _ will _ beat _ me _ by _ a _ couple _ rows _ of _ this _
that E 's E that _ 's _ like _ the _ washing E would _ say _ washing _ machine _
or _ let _ me _ see _
i _ ca _ n't _
oh _ that _ 's _ the _ son _ come _ out E of E from _ school _ maybe _ or _ something _
that _ 's _ a _ youngster _ there _
well _ that _ 's _ just _ as _ though _ they _
and _ right _ there _ he _ 's _ uh _ same _ as _ back _ there _ except _ for _ down _ there _ in _ the _ bottom _ i _ think _ it _ 's _
uh _ that _ 's _ a _ little _
the _ little _ boy _ is _ up _ on E uh _ on _ this _ thing _ here _
and _ it E 's E he _ 's _ up _ trying _ to _ get _ something _ out _ of _ the _ garden _ selection _ i _ think _ it _ is _
the _ little _ girl _ i _ think _ is _ mad _ because _ she _ did _ n't _ get _ some _ of _ it _
and _ here _ 's _ mama _ drying _ the _ dishes _
no _ just _ the _ little _ girl _ and _ the _ boy _ was _ on _ here _
the _ little _ girl _ and _ the _ boy _
she _ 's _ reaching _ up _ to _ the _ boy _ and _ the _ boy _ is _ got _ his _ other _ hand _ down _
so _
it _ looks _ color _
no _ that _ 's _ all _
oh _ she _ spilled _ something _ i _ think _
from _ the _ sink _ down _
it _ came _ splashing _ down _
that _ 's _ the _ first _ i _ noticed _ it _
i _ 'm _ terrible _ anymore _
uh _ well _ the _ children _ are _ climbing _ up _ and _ he _ 's _ about _ to _ fall _
and _ he _ 's _ getting _ cookies _
and _ she _ 's _ uh _ telling _ him _ to _ be _ quiet _ so _ mother _ wo E n't E hear E it E wo _ n't _ hear _ him _ getting _ up _ there _
and _ uh _ he _ 's _ handing _ a _ cookie _ down _ to _ her _
she _ 's _ washing _ the _ dishes _
and _ uh _
whether _ she _ 's _ up _ i _ ca _ n't _ believe _ she _ 's _ upset _ about _ the _ kids _ because _ she _ has _ n't _ seen _ them _
maybe _ she _ did _ turn _ and _ look _ at _ them _ and _ then _ go _ back _ to _ the _ dishes _
in _ other _ words _ it _ 's _ uh _
uh _ she E she _ 's _ deciding _ that _ if _ she _ did _ see _ them _ she _ 's _ deciding _ that _ she _ 's _ going _ to _ let _ them _ go _ ahead _ with _ it _
but _ i _ do _ n't _ think _ she _ would _ have _ let _ them _ go _ ahead _ if _ she _ saw _ the _ little _ boy _ falling _
i _ think _ she _ would _ have _ turned _
maybe _ dropped _ her _ dish _
but _ she _ would _ have _ gotten _ hold _ of _ him _ and _ saved _ him _ from _ being _ harmed _ in _ the _ fall _
and _ he _ might _ just _ pull _ all _ the _ cookie _ jar _ with _ him _ when _ he _ falls _ too _
and _ with _ the _ water _ on _ the _ floor _ and _ the _ cookie _ jar _ on _ the _ floor _ it _ would _ be _ a _ sad _
threesome _ but E and _ the _ kitchen _ would _ be _ a _ mess _
oh _ yes _
a E little E girl E a E and _ the _ little _ boy _ is _ getting _ cookies _ out _ of _ the _ jar _
oh _ and _ the _ stool _ is _ upsetting _
and _ the E i _ guess _ it E 's E the _ mother _ is _ drying _ dishes _
water _ 's _ spilling _ down _ all _ over _ the _ sink _
water _ on _ the _ floor _
little _ boy _ 's _ gonna _ fall _ and _ that E steps E uh _ that _ there _ stool _
uh _ i _ think _ the _ cookie _ jar _ is _ gonna _ fall _
and _ the _ guess _ drying _ dishes _ and _ water _ the _ faucet _ 's _ on _ and _ water _ 's _ running _ all _ over _ the _ floor _
wh _ what _ else _ am _ i _ sup _ i _ mean _ what E what _
yeah _
the _ cookie _ jar _
the _ stool _
her _ doing _ the _ dishes _
the _ water _ spilling _
far E as E yeah _ that _ 's _ as _ far _ as _ i _ could _ see _
and _ i _ will _ tell _ you _ what _ 's _ g _
oh _ boy _
well _ the _ little _ boy _ is _ reaching _ for _ a _ cookie _
and _ his _ s _ stool _ is _ falling _ over _
and _ the _ little _ girl _ is _ begging _ him _ to _ give _ her _ one _
and _ she _ 's _ pointing _ to _ her _ mouth _
she _ wants _ to _ eat _ it _
uh _ their _ mama _ is _ doing _ the _ dishes _
the _ water _ 's _ running _ over _ the _ sink _
that _ 's _ a _ mess _
and _ then _ she _ 's _ not _ even _ looking _ at _ them _
drying _ dishes _
i _ think _ she _ 's _ looking _ out _ the _ window _
it _ 's _ a _ nice _ yard _ out _ there _
two _ cups _ and E and _ a _ dish _ finished _
anything _ else _
i _ see _ a _ tad _ bit _
and _ somebody _ is _ doing _ drying _ dishes _
no E i E ca E n't E no _ i _ ca _ n't _ get _ this _ very _ well _ clear _
well _ someone _ 's _ standing _ on _ a _ stool _ and _ the _ stool _ is _ getting _ ready _ to _ fall _ over _
it _ 's _ mm _ well _ somebody _ 's _ drying _ dishes _
no _ i _ do _ n't _ see _ anything _ else _ going _ on _ over _ here _
i E 'm E i _ 'm _ thinking _ now _ maybe _ the _ water _ 's _ r _ overrunning _
i _ 'm _ not _ too _ sure _
there _ 's _ some _ water _ on _ the _ floor _ here _
and _ there _ 's _ some _ in _ the _ sink _ that _ 's _ overrunning _
an _ average _ home _ that _ looks _ very _ much _ like _ ours _ at _ many _ times _
and _ the _ mother _ is _ well _ she _ 's _ spilling _ her _ water _ which _ is _ not _ very _ good _ but _ she _ 's _ doing E washing _ dishes _ and _ drying _ them _
and _ one _ of _ the _ children _ upset _ the _ cookie _ jar _
and _ that _ 's _ an _ very _ average _ thing _ to _ go _ in E in _ a _ home _
our _ home _ is E a E very E it _ 's _ a _ very _ active _ family _
and _ so _ that E it _ makes _ it _ kinda _ hard _ at _ our _ house _ sometime _ because _ uh _ there _ 's _ a E lot E of E ac E like _ i _ said _ a _ lot _ of _ activity _
well _ the _ poor _ girl _ is _ spilling _ the _ water _ on _ her _ feet _
it _ 's _ gonna _ be _ k _ wet _ but _ then _ she _ 'll _ hafta _ struggle _ with _ that _
also _ there _ are _ a _ few _ more _ dishes _ left _ that _ did _ n't _ get _ finished _
this _ hasta _ be _ the _ dishes _
and _ how _ that _ little _ boy _ fell _ off _ that _ stool _ i _ do _ n't _ know _ but _ he _ did _
no _
okay _
uh _ there E 's E a E cook E a E b E a E boy E 's E a _ boy _ is _ uh _ taking _ uh _ cookies _ and _ uh _ giving _ one _ to _ the _ girl _ imagine _
and _ she _ wants _ one _
i _ do _ n't _ know _
the _ uh _ mother _ 's _ uh _ washing _ dishes _
she _ spilled _ it _
uh _ she _ 's _ washing _ dishes _
and _ uh _
huh _
alright _
oh _
uh _ oh _ he _ 's _ gonna _ fall _
and E uh _ and _ she _ 's _ laughing _ at _ them _ there _
i _ do _ n't _ know _ what _ else _
i _ do _ n't _ know _
um _ t _ taking _ some _ cookies _
and _ f _ falling _ over _
and _ uh _ mother _ 's _ drying _ dishes _
and _ things _ falling _ uh _ um _
sink _ 's _ running _ over _
and _ two _ cups _ and _ saucer _ on _ the _ plate _ uh _ on _ the _ sink _
and _ uh _
and _ the _ girl _ 's _ um _ um _
cookies _ i _ mean _ um _ uh _ windows _ on _ the _ curtains _
and _ um _ the _ spigot _ 's _ on _ the _ sink _
and _ uh _
well _ that _ 's _ about _ it _
the _ boy _ 's _ uh _ falling _ off _ the _ stool _
the E the _ girl _ 's _ got _ her _ hand _ up _
the _ lady _ 's _ wa _ drying _ dishes _
the _ water _ is _ spilling _ on _ the _ floor _
faucet _ 's _ on _
the _ boy _ 's _ trying _ to _ get _ a _ cookie _ jar _ out _
l _ lid _ 's _ off _ of _ it _
sink _ 's _ by _ the _ window _
that _ 's _ all _ i _ know _
okay _ i _ see _ a _ boy _ in _ the _ cookie _ jar _
i E see _ he _ has _ the _ lid _ off _
i _ see _ that _ he _ is _ standing _ on _ a _ three _ legged _ stool _ and _ he _ 's _ about _ to _ depart _ from _ that _ three _ legged _ stool _
he _ has _ one _ cookie _ in _ his _ hand _ handing _ it _ down _ to _ his _ sister _ and _ she _ 's _ reaching _ up _ for _ it _
and _ i _ think _ she _ 's _ indicating _ to _ the _ boy _ to _ keep _ still _ so _ his _ mother _ does _ n't _ hear _ what _ 's _ going _ on _
i _ see _ the _ mother _
uh _ i _ guess _ she _ 's _ drying _ the _ dishes _ and _ she _ 's _ not _ paying _ attention _ because _ she _ 's _ uh _ leaving _ the _ sink _ run _ over _ and _ it _ 's _ spilling _ all _ over _ the _ floor _
and _ she _ must _ not _ be _ conscious _ because _ she _ 's _ standing _ in _ it _ and _ does _ n't _ know _ it _
um _ sh _ i E think E she E must E i _ think _ she _ 's _ probably _ looking _ out _ the _ window _ as _ i _ take _ the _ second _ look _
and _ i _ see _ apparently _ a _ couple _ dirty _ dishes _ on _ the _ table _
i _ see _ the _ cupboards _
uh _ i _ do _ n't _ know _ whether _ they _ all _ have _ knobs _ on _ them _ or _ not _
does _ n't _ look _ like _ the _ two _ where _ the _ boy _ and _ the _ girl _ are E have _ knobs _ on _ the _ cupboard _ door _
and _ i _ see _ outside _
i E see E uh _ apparently _ it _ 's _ a _ tree _ some _ shrubbery _ and _ some _ hedges _
about _ it _

i _ do _ n't _ know _

and _ if _ we _ made _ a _ mess _ like _ that _ you _ 'd _ get _ a _ kick _ in _ the _ ass _
well _ we _ have _ uh _ spilling _ of _ the _ water _
and _ a _ kid _ with _ his _ cookie _ jar _
and _ a _ stool _ is _ turned _ over _
and _ a _ mother _ 's _ running _ the _ water _ on _ the _ floor _
and _ what _ else _ do _ you _ want _ from _ that _
it _ s _ looks _ like _ somebody _ 's _ laying _ out _ in _ the _ grass _ does _ n't _ it _
and _ a _ kid _ in _ the _ cookie _ jar _
and _ a _ tilted _ s _ stool _
what _ more _ do _ you _ want _
the E wa E the _ water _ rolling _ on _ the _ floor _
this _ is _ uh _ a _ clause _ copy _ copy _ by _ his _
yeah _ uhhuh _
a _
the _ sun _
mhm _
his _
ample _ rice _ discharged _
charged _
flexible _
flexible _
my _ husband _ and _ uh _
is _ there _ somebody _ else _ there _
her E too _ her _
uh _ last _ name _ yeah _
yeah _
a _ lovely _ girl _
a E do _ guess _ getting _ older _ i E see E i _ so _
oh _ no _
this E is E oh _ i _ can _ just _
mhm _
well _ the _ kids _ is _ robbing _ a _ cookie _ jar _
and _ uh _ the _ mother _ is _ uh _ washing _ dishes _ and _ forgetting _ that _ the _ water _ is _ running _
it _ 's _ running _ on _ the _ floor _
and _ his _ stool _ is _ about _ to _ dump _ him _
see _ here _
he _ 's _ about _ to _ go _
now _ i _ think _ that _ 's _ just _ about _ all _ i _ can _ see _ that E 's E that _ you _ might _ be _ looking _ for _
he _ 's _ about _ to _ drop _ off _ that _ stool _ too _
mhm _
uh _ they _ s _ the _ cookie _ jar _
with _ the _ hm _
but _ that _ is _ n't _ the _ right _ thing _
but _ their _ mother _ was _ there _
this _ would _ n't _ be _ the _ grandmother _ i _ guess _
it _ 's _ the _ children _
uh _ well _ i _ think _ he _ 's _ going _ to _ fall _ pretty _ quick _
but _ uh _ she _ was _ helping _
handing E he _ handed _ uh _ the _ cookies _ to _ his _ sister _ i _ guess _
well _ it _ uh _
the _ mother _ was _ drying _ her _
she _ better _ get _ the _ uh _ water _ off _
well _ he _ might _ fall _ soon _ if _ he _ does _ n't _
but _ he _ 's _ careful _
i _ think _ so _
oh _ there _ 's _ a _ cookie _ jar _ and _ a _ youngster _ with _ a _ i _ do _ n't _ know _ what _ he _ got _ cookie _ jar _
and _ the _ boy _ has _ a _ shirt _ with _ a _ cookie _ j _ jar _ too _ i _ guess _

and _ this _ is _ uh _ with _ a _ kitchen _ thing _ k _ dishes _
and _ this _ is _ water _ somebody _ spilled _

and _
i E me _ i _ c _ i _ ca _ n't _ really _ pick _ it _ out _ but _
oh _ and _ there _ 's _ a _ girl _ here _ talking _ and _ a _ boy _ i _ assume _ on _ this _ side _ here _
and _ this _ is _ a _ highchair _ here _
and _ uh _
i _ ca _ n't _ see _ what _ that _ is _

yeah _ that _ 's _ awfully _ hard _ for _ me _ to _ distinguish _
oh _ it _ 's _ the _ same _ picture _
you _ should _ give _ me _ a _ different _ one _
why _
it _ would _ be _ more _ fun _ if _ you _ had _ some _ variety _
okay _
we _ have _ here _ a _ scene _ in _ a _ kitchen _ and _ it _ looks _ as _ though _ that _ 's _ a _ mama _ who _ is _ working _ at _ the _ sink _ and _ her _ two _ children _
and _ the _ two _ children _ are _ hoping _ that _ mama _ will _ not _ notice _ because _ she _ 's _ looking _ out _ the _ window _ that _ they _ are _ getting _ into _ the _ cookie _ jar _
so _ the _ boy _ climbs _ up _ on _ a _ stool _ to _ reach _ the _ cookie _ jar _
and _ as _ he _ 's _ getting _ up _ there _ the E s _ the _ tool _ the _ stool _ is _ tilting _ and _ he _ looks _ as _ though _ he _ were _ about _ to _ fall _ over _
and _ the _ little _ girl _ is _ telling _ him _ to _ be _ quiet _ by _ putting _ her _ finger _ on _ her _ lips _
he _ has _ one _ cookie _ in _ his _ hand _ is _ reaching _ for _ another _ one _
the _ lid _ is _ off _ the _ cookie _ jar _
the _ cupboard _ door _ is _ open _
he E 's E supposedly E going E to E hand E one E cookie E it _ looks _ as _ though _ he _ is _ to _ his _ sister _ and _ grab _ another _ one _ for _ himself _ but _ i _ doubt _ he _ 's _ that _ he _ 's _ gonna _ get _ all _ that _ done _ before _ the _ stool _ falls _ over _
on _ the _ other _ around _ the _ corner _ of _ the _ kitchen _ uh _ um _ there _ 's _ a _ counter _ that _ uh _ sort _ of _ turns _ a _ corner _
there _ are _ cupboards _ below _ the _ counter _ and _ above _ the _ counter _ where _ the _ cookies _ are _
then _ when _ you _ get _ over _ and _ have _ turned _ a _ corner _ in _ the _ kitchen _ you _ have _ base _ cabinets _ and _ then _ you _ have _ a _ window _ above _ that _ which _ is _ looking _ out _ into _ something _ which _ makes _ it _ looks _ as _ though _ it _ 's _ summer _ outside _ because _ the _ window _ is _ open _
there _ are _ things _ growing _ out _ there _
there _ 's _ a _ walk _
there _ 's _ uh _ uh _ some _ shrubbery _ underneath _ another _ window _ that E looks E it _ 's _ in _ a E another _ wing _ of _ the _ house _
there _ 's _ a _ tree _ beyond _
there _ are _ tie _ back _ curtains _ at _ the _ window _
the _ mother _ is _ working _ at _ the _ sink _ and _ the _ faucet _ is _ left _ on _ and _ apparently _ there _ 's _ no _ overflow _ in _ the _ sink _ so _ it _ 's _ overflowing _ right _ onto _ the _ floor _
and _ uh _ she _ has _ on _ a _ sleeveless _ dress _ which _ also _ indicates _ that _ it _ 's _ summer _
and _ it _ looks _ though _ she _ has _ an _ apron _ on _
she _ has _ short _ hair _
um _ she _ is _ drying _ a _ dish _ with _ a _ tea _ towel _ a _ plate _ with _ a _ tea _ towel _
um _ beside _ the _ sink _ there _ are _ two _ cups _ and _ a _ plate _
looks _ as _ though _ there _ 's _ some _ suds _ and _ some _ dishes _ in _ the _ sink _
and _ two _ faucets _ with _ type _ handles _ one _ on _ either _ side _ and _ a _ center _ faucet _
she _ has _ shoes _ on _ with _ no _ ties _ just _ sort _ of _ slip _
there _ 's _ a _ little _ scallop _ valance _ across _ the _ top _ of _ the _ curtains _
hm _
well _ the _ handles _ on _ the _ door _ are _ the _ kind _ that _ are _ just _ um _ almost _ like _ a _ round _ piece _ of _ wood _ that _ you _ hafta _ get _ a _ hold _ of _ to _ pull _ the _ cupboard _ door _ open _
and _ what _ 's _ really _ strange _ is _ that _ you _ ca _ n't _ see _ any _ handles _ on _ the _ cupboards _ on _ the _ other _ side _ of _ the _ kitchen _
the _ pearl _ mo _ mom _ 's _ getting _ her _ wet _ feet _ wet _ because _ she _ thinking _ of _ days _ gone _ by _ and _ then _ the _ water _ run _
and _ uh _ that _ boy _ whether _ he _ knows _ or _ not _ he _ 's _ gonna _ crack _ his _ head _ on _ the _ back _ of _ that _ counter _ trying _ to _ get _ too _ many _ cookies _ out _
he _
unless _ that _ 's _ the _ way _ all _ silly _ girls _ act _ at _ that _ age _
pardon _
oh _ sure _
there _ 's _ no _ handles _ on _ the E uh _ the _ cabinet _ drawers _ under _ the _ counter _ on E his E on _ the _ left _ side _
and _ uh _ over _ in _ the E the _ window _ you _ see _ through _ the _ kitchen _ window _ all _ the _ styles _ are _ not _ in _ the _ glass _
and _ if _ the _ kitchen _ window _ 's _ the _ same _ type _ of _ window _ as _ well _ the _ other _ part _ of _ the _ house _ the _ style _ 's _ only _ in _ the _
maybe _ they _ build _ them _ that _ way _
no _ but _ i E did E n E i _ did _ notice _ that _ 's _ a _ little _ i _ would _ n't _ say _ unusual _ but E uh _ but _
pardon _
i _ said _ that _ the _ sink _ was _ overflowing _
the _ mother _ 's _ wet _ getting _ her _ feet _ wet _
the _ boy _ 's _ going _ to _ fall _ very _ hard _ and _ hurt _ himself _
and _ nobody _ 's _ gonna _ help _ him _
well _ happening _
did _ i _ say _ the _ cabinet _ doors _ where _ the _ kids _ are E have _ no _ handles _ on _ them _
oh _ there _ 's _ got _ to _ be _ a _ dozen _ other _ things _
responsible _
well _ i _ 'll _ tell _ you _ the _ way _ mom _ is _ looking _ there _ 's _ not _ much _ going _ on _ in _ her _ head _
she _ 's _ thinking _ of _ dad _
and _ the _ little _ girl _ is _ saying _
do _ n't _ tell _ mom _
the _ conflict _ 's _ in _ whereas E the E what _ she _ 's _ thinking _ whereas _ she _ did _ n't _ know _ the _ kids _ are _ behind _ her _
and _ did _ i _ say _
the _ cabinet _ doors _ are E n't E the E same E are _ different _ sizes _
have _ no _ handles _
i _ guess _ you _ take _ a _ big _ sledge _ hammer _ to _ that _
well _ the E uh _ the _ little _ boy _ is _
he _ 's _ uh _ partially _ gonna _ fall _ off _ the _ stool _
his _ sister _ is _ telling _ him _ to _ be _ quiet _
the _ mother _ is _ washing _ dishes _
and _ uh _ the _ water _ is _ overflowing _ onto _ the _ floor _ and _ she _ 's _ standing _ in _ a _ puddle _ and _
well _ the _ sink _ is _ running _ over _
she _ 's _ drying _ the _ dishes _
they _ 're _ getting _ in _ the _ cookie _ jar _ and _ they _ 're _ upsetting _ the _ stool _
the _ girl _ is _ reaching _ for _ a _ cookie _
the _ lady _ here _ 's _ standing _ right _ in _ the _ water _
she _ seems _ to _ be _ looking _ out _ the _ window _ at _ the _ lawn _
that _ 's _ about _ it _ right _
i _ s _ see _ this _ woman _ who _ 's _ standing _ by _ the _ sink _ washing _ dishes _ and _ the _ water _ 's _ spilling _ out _ over _ the _ sink _
and _ i _ see _ a E little E this _ little _ boy _ standing _ on _ a _ stool _ reaching _ for _ cookies _ and _ he _ looks _ like _ he _ 's _ ready _ to _ fall _
uh _ as _ far _ as _ action _ goes _ i _ do _ n't _ know _ if _ i _ see _ any _ more _ action _ in _ there _ at _ all _
it _ 's _ a _ family _ affair _ a _ mother _ and _ the _ children _
and _ uh _ they _ 're _ each _ busy _ at E at _ uh _ something _
and _ the _ um _
but _ they _ seem _ happy _ in _ doing _ their _ own _ thing _
i _ do _ n't _ think _ i E i _ lost _ that _
i _ think _ i _
well _ the _ little _ girl _ is _ reaching _ for _ a _ cookie _

uh _ the _ mother _ is _ looking _ out _ the _ window _ while _ the _ water _ runs _ over _ from _ the _ sink _

yes _
they _ 're _ reaching _ up _ for _ a _ cookie _ in _ cookie _ jar _
and _ they _ 're _ cooking _ a _ turkey _ dinner _ i _ guess _
cooking _ a _ turkey _ dinner _
she _ 's _ doing _ the _ dishes _
this _ little _ boy _ might _ fall _ off _ of _ that _ stool _ he _ 's _ on _
and _ the _ water _ 's _ splashing _ out _ all _ over _ the _ floor _ and _ she _ does _ n't _ know _ it _
and _ the E boy E might E he _ 's _ looking _ for _ the _ cookie _ jar _ and _ he _ might _ bang _ his _ head _ on _ the _
uh _ the _ boy _ is _ reaching _ into _ the _ cookie _ jar _
he _ 's _ falling _ off _ the _ stool _
the _ little _ girl _ is _ reaching _ for _ a _ cookie _
mother _ is _ drying _ the _ dishes _
the _ sink _ is _ running _ over _
mother _ 's _ getting _ her _ feet _ wet _
they _ all _ have _ shoes _ on _
there _ 's _ a _ cup _ two _ cups _ and _ a _ saucer _ on _ the _ sink _
the _ window _ has _ draw _ withdrawn _ drapes _

oh _ what _ 's _ happening _
mother _ is _ looking _ out _ the _ window _
the _ girl _ is _ touching _ her _ lips _
the _ boy _ is _ standing _ on _ his _ right _ foot _
his _ left _ foot _ is _ sort _ of _ up _ in _ the _ air _
mother _ 's _ right _ foot _ is _ flat _ on _ the _ floor _ and _ her _ left _ she _ 's _ on _ her _ left _ toe _
uh _ she _ 's _ holding _ the _ dish _ cloth _ in _ her _ right _ hand _ and _ the _ plate _ she _ is _ drying _ in _ her _ left _

he _ has _ the _ cookie _ jar _ opened _
he _ 's _ reaching _ for _ one _ for _ himself _
he _ 's _ handing _ one _ down _ to _ his _ sister _
the _ three _ legged _ stool _ is _ coming _ down _ with _ him _
uh _ they _ 're _ nicely _ dressed _ kids _ but _ uh _ the _ boy _ needs _ his _ socks _ pulled _ up _
mm _ that _ 's _ all _ i _ see _ there _
mother E i _ presume _ it E 's E mother _ is _ at _ the _ sink _
the _ water _ is _ r E running _ over _ out _ of _ sink _
she _ 's _ drying _ a _ dish _
she _ 's _ looking _ out _ the _ window _
there _ are _ two _ cups _ and _ a _ dish _ i _ presume _ that _ 's _ a _ dish _ that _ are _ already _ dry _ i _ guess _ and _ sitting _ on _ the _ side _ of _ the _ sink _
uh _ nicely _ groomed _
nice _ curtains _ pulled _ back _
it _ 's _ apparently _ summer _ outside _ because _ the _ window _ 's _ open _ and _ it _ looks _ like _ shrubs _ are _ growing _
you _ can _ see _ a _ window _ in _ the _ other _ part _ of _ the _ house _
i _ presume _ that _ 's _ still _ their _ house _
and _ there _ 's _ a _ driveway _ bordered _ with _ grass _
and _ there _ 's _ a _ tree _ out _ there _ somewhere _ that _ you _ can _ see _ part _ of _ the _ trunk _ and _ part _ of _ the _ foliage _
and _ uh _ i _ see _ cabinets _ around _ the _ kitchen _ other _ cabinets _
and _ that _ 's _ about _ it _
oh _ little _ boy _ 's _ in _ the _ cookie _ jar _
the _ girl _ 's _ standing _ down _ and _ waiting _ for _ him _ to _ give E him E some E give _ her _ some _
the _ mother _ 's _ doing _ the _ dishes _
and _ she _ 's _ also _ letting E him E letting _ hm _
oh _ the _ water _ just _ fell _ off _ over _ on _ the _ floor _
uh _ can _ i _ turn _ the _ page _
okay _
that _ 's _ all _ there _ is _ except _ she _ 's _ just _ getting _ all _ wet _
no _
the _ little _ girl _ was _ helping _ the _ boy _ to _ get _ to _ the _ cookie _ jar _
but _ he _ started _ stumbling _
he _ must _ have _ fell _ over _ because _ he _ seems _ to _ be _ falling _ there _
and _ the _ mother _ 's _ over _ at _ the _ sink _ drying _ dishes _
and _ it _ 's _ going _ on _ the _ floor _
and _ three E cups E three _ bowls _ there _
mhm _
the _ little _ boy _ is _ reaching _ for _ a _ cookie _
and _ he _ 's _ falling _ at _ the _ same _ time _ because _ the _ stool _ has _ tipped _ over _
his _ little _ sister _ is _ reaching _ for _ a _ cookie _ and _ i _ think _ beginning _ to _ laugh _ because _ he _ 's _ falling _
the _ sink _ is _ running _ over _ and _ dripping _ water _ on _ the _ floor _ while _ the _ mother _ is _ trying _ to _ dry _ the _ dishes _
um _ the _ window _ is _ open _ and _ the _ curtains _ are _ blowing _ in _ the _ breeze _ coming _ in _ from _ outside _
the _ water _ is _ running _ in _ the _ sink _
that _ 's _ why _ it _ 's _ overflowing _
i _ also _ believe _ that _ the _ mother _ is _ daydreaming _
possibly _ worrying _ about _ uh _ something _
that _ 's _ it _
that _ 's _ all _ i _ see _
hm _
it _ 's _ a _ little _ boy _ climbing _ up _ getting _ some _ coo _ cookies _ out _ of _ the _ cookie _ jar _
and _ his _ little _ sister _ reaching _ for _ some _
and _ the _ little _ boy _ is _ standing _ on _ a _ ladder _
and _ his _ big _ sister _ washing _ the _ dishes _ at _ the _ sink _
big _ sister _ washing _ the _ dishes _ and _ then _ she E got E she _ got _ uh _ dishes _ on _ the _ s _ sitting _ on _ the _ sink _

uh _ the _ water _ is _ still _ running _ in _ the _ sink _
and _ splashing _ on _ the _ floor _
well _ the _ mother _ has _ water _ spilling _ all _ over _ the _ floor _ for _ one _ thing _
then _ she _ 's _ starting _ to _ dry _ the _ dishes _
and _ then _ she _ 's _ looking _ out _ the _ window _
and _ uh _ the _ little _ girl _ 's _ there _ and _ the _ little _ boy _ and _ he _ almost _ is _ falling _ off _ the _ stool _

and _ sh _ she _ 's _ standing _ there _
it _ 's _ falling _ on _ the _ floor _

no _
okay _
anywhere _
um _ the _ little _ girl _ 's _ laughing _
the _ little _ boy _ 's _ getting _ cookies _ and _ he _ 's _ falling _
uh _ i _ guess _ the _ mother _ would _ be _ doing _ dishes _ and _ the _ water _ 's _ overflowing _ out _ of _ the _ sink _
uh _ the _ window _ 's _ open _ and _ i _ would _ say _ the _ wind _ is _ blowing _
i _ guess _ that _ 's _ it _
you _ mean _ like _ the _ woman _ doing _ the _ dishes _ and _ the _ water _ running _ out E of E the E in _ the _ sink _
little _ boy _ is _ getting _ in _ the _ cookie _ jar _

and _ the _ boy _ he _ 's _ reaching _ up _ for _ cookies _
and _ he E his _ ladder _ slipped _ from _ underneath _ him _
and _ i _ guess _ he _ 's _ gonna _ have _ an _ accident _
and _ the _ little _ girl _ she _ 's _ waiting _ for _ the _ cookies _ but _ i _ do _ n't _ think _ she _ 's _ gonna _ to _ get _ them _ because _ the _ boy _ 's _ falling _ down _
well _ the _ boy _ is _ getting _ cookies _ and _ he _ 's _ gonna _ fall _ off _ the _ stool _
and _ the _ mother _ is _ doing _ dishes _

uh _ there _ is _ a _ cup _ and _ a _ saucer _ on _ the _ uh _ uh _ sink _ board _
and _ uh _ there _ 's _ the _ uh _ drapes _ on _ the _ kitchen _ uh _ the _ curtains _ on _ the _ kitchen _ and _ the E the _ cabinets _ all _ around _ the _ sink _
and _ the _ top _ cabinets _ the _ door _ is _ open _ and _ the _ cookie _ jar _ is _ in _ the _ cabinet _
the _ boy _ is _ up _ there _ reaching _ for _ it _ and _ it _ looks _ like _ he _ 's _ gonna _ fall _ off _ of _ the _ stool _
and _ outside _ is _ a _ nice _ garden _ with _ the _ path _ leading _ around _ the _ house _ and _ bushes _ and _ shrubs _ and _ grass _ growing _ around _
she _ has _ a _ dish _ towel _ in _ her _ hand _ wa _ doing _ drying _ one _ of _ the _ dishes _
and _ she _ has _ uh _ her _ hairdo _
she _ 's _ wearing _ an _ apron _
and _ the _ kids _ were _ wearing _ shoes _
and _ sh _ she _ 's _ wearing _ shoes _
and _ the _ water _ 's _ dripping _ on _ the _ floor _
what _ else _ you _ wanna _ know _
well _ he _ 's _ into _ the _ cookie _ jar _ and _ the E the _ uh _ stool _ is _ falling _ down _
she _ 's _ doing _ dishes _ and _ the _ sink _ 's _ running _ over _ and _ wetting _ her _ feet _
and _ she _ look E does _ n't _ look _ too _ happy _
anything _ else _
she _ 's _ drying _ the _ dishes _
right _
and _ the _ kid _ 's _ in _ the _ cookie _ jars _
how _ many _ things _ are _ sposta _ be _ wrong _
yeah _ i _ see _ the _ woman _ 's _ in _ a _ kitchen _
and _
i E me _ i _ c _ i _ ca _ n't _ really _ pick _ it _ out _ but _
oh _ and _ there _ 's _ a _ girl _ here _ talking _ and _ a _ boy _ i _ assume _ on _ this _ side _ here _
and _ this _ is _ a _ highchair _ here _
and _ uh _
i _ ca _ n't _ see _ what _ that _ is _
oh _ there _ 's _ another _
did _ i _ talk _ about _ this _ girl _ up _ here _
she _ 's _ uh _
i _ ca _ n't _ see _ too _ plain _ what _ she _ 's _ doing _
oh _ yes _ i _ think _ so _
where _ was _ she _
this _ girl _
i _ really _ ca _ n't _ see _ what _ she _ 's _ doing _
no _ uh _ i _ do _ n't _
yeah _ that _ 's _ awfully _ hard _ for _ me _ to _ distinguish _
oh _ it _ 's _ the _ same _ picture _
you _ should _ give _ me _ a _ different _ one _
why _
it _ would _ be _ more _ fun _ if _ you _ had _ some _ variety _
okay _
we _ have _ here _ a _ scene _ in _ a _ kitchen _ and _ it _ looks _ as _ though _ that _ 's _ a _ mama _ who _ is _ working _ at _ the _ sink _ and _ her _ two _ children _
and _ the _ two _ children _ are _ hoping _ that _ mama _ will _ not _ notice _ because _ she _ 's _ looking _ out _ the _ window _ that _ they _ are _ getting _ into _ the _ cookie _ jar _
so _ the _ boy _ climbs _ up _ on _ a _ stool _ to _ reach _ the _ cookie _ jar _
and _ as _ he _ 's _ getting _ up _ there _ the E s _ the _ tool _ the _ stool _ is _ tilting _ and _ he _ looks _ as _ though _ he _ were _ about _ to _ fall _ over _
and _ the _ little _ girl _ is _ telling _ him _ to _ be _ quiet _ by _ putting _ her _ finger _ on _ her _ lips _
he _ has _ one _ cookie _ in _ his _ hand _ is _ reaching _ for _ another _ one _
the _ lid _ is _ off _ the _ cookie _ jar _
the _ cupboard _ door _ is _ open _
he E 's E supposedly E going E to E hand E one E cookie E it _ looks _ as _ though _ he _ is _ to _ his _ sister _ and _ grab _ another _ one _ for _ himself _ but _ i _ doubt _ he _ 's _ that _ he _ 's _ gonna _ get _ all _ that _ done _ before _ the _ stool _ falls _ over _
on _ the _ other _ around _ the _ corner _ of _ the _ kitchen _ uh _ um _ there _ 's _ a _ counter _ that _ uh _ sort _ of _ turns _ a _ corner _
there _ are _ cupboards _ below _ the _ counter _ and _ above _ the _ counter _ where _ the _ cookies _ are _
then _ when _ you _ get _ over _ and _ have _ turned _ a _ corner _ in _ the _ kitchen _ you _ have _ base _ cabinets _ and _ then _ you _ have _ a _ window _ above _ that _ which _ is _ looking _ out _ into _ something _ which _ makes _ it _ looks _ as _ though _ it _ 's _ summer _ outside _ because _ the _ window _ is _ open _
there _ are _ things _ growing _ out _ there _
there _ 's _ a _ walk _
there _ 's _ uh _ uh _ some _ shrubbery _ underneath _ another _ window _ that E looks E it _ 's _ in _ a E another _ wing _ of _ the _ house _
there _ 's _ a _ tree _ beyond _
there _ are _ tie _ back _ curtains _ at _ the _ window _
the _ mother _ is _ working _ at _ the _ sink _ and _ the _ faucet _ is _ left _ on _ and _ apparently _ there _ 's _ no _ overflow _ in _ the _ sink _ so _ it _ 's _ overflowing _ right _ onto _ the _ floor _
and _ uh _ she _ has _ on _ a _ sleeveless _ dress _ which _ also _ indicates _ that _ it _ 's _ summer _
and _ it _ looks _ though _ she _ has _ an _ apron _ on _
she _ has _ short _ hair _
um _ she _ is _ drying _ a _ dish _ with _ a _ tea _ towel _ a _ plate _ with _ a _ tea _ towel _
um _ beside _ the _ sink _ there _ are _ two _ cups _ and _ a _ plate _
looks _ as _ though _ there _ 's _ some _ suds _ and _ some _ dishes _ in _ the _ sink _
and _ two _ faucets _ with _ type _ handles _ one _ on _ either _ side _ and _ a _ center _ faucet _
she _ has _ shoes _ on _ with _ no _ ties _ just _ sort _ of _ slip _
there _ 's _ a _ little _ scallop _ valance _ across _ the _ top _ of _ the _ curtains _
hm _
well _ the _ handles _ on _ the _ door _ are _ the _ kind _ that _ are _ just _ um _ almost _ like _ a _ round _ piece _ of _ wood _ that _ you _ hafta _ get _ a _ hold _ of _ to _ pull _ the _ cupboard _ door _ open _
and _ what _ 's _ really _ strange _ is _ that _ you _ ca _ n't _ see _ any _ handles _ on _ the _ cupboards _ on _ the _ other _ side _ of _ the _ kitchen _
the _ pearl _ mo _ mom _ 's _ getting _ her _ wet _ feet _ wet _ because _ she _ thinking _ of _ days _ gone _ by _ and _ then _ the _ water _ run _
and _ uh _ that _ boy _ whether _ he _ knows _ or _ not _ he _ 's _ gonna _ crack _ his _ head _ on _ the _ back _ of _ that _ counter _ trying _ to _ get _ too _ many _ cookies _ out _
he _
unless _ that _ 's _ the _ way _ all _ silly _ girls _ act _ at _ that _ age _
pardon _
oh _ sure _
there _ 's _ no _ handles _ on _ the E uh _ the _ cabinet _ drawers _ under _ the _ counter _ on E his E on _ the _ left _ side _
and _ uh _ over _ in _ the E the _ window _ you _ see _ through _ the _ kitchen _ window _ all _ the _ styles _ are _ not _ in _ the _ glass _
and _ if _ the _ kitchen _ window _ 's _ the _ same _ type _ of _ window _ as _ well _ the _ other _ part _ of _ the _ house _ the _ style _ 's _ only _ in _ the _
maybe _ they _ build _ them _ that _ way _
no _ but _ i E did E n E i _ did _ notice _ that _ 's _ a _ little _ i _ would _ n't _ say _ unusual _ but E uh _ but _
pardon _
i _ said _ that _ the _ sink _ was _ overflowing _
the _ mother _ 's _ wet _ getting _ her _ feet _ wet _
the _ boy _ 's _ going _ to _ fall _ very _ hard _ and _ hurt _ himself _
and _ nobody _ 's _ gonna _ help _ him _
well _ happening _
did _ i _ say _ the _ cabinet _ doors _ where _ the _ kids _ are E have _ no _ handles _ on _ them _
oh _ there _ 's _ got _ to _ be _ a _ dozen _ other _ things _
responsible _
well _ i _ 'll _ tell _ you _ the _ way _ mom _ is _ looking _ there _ 's _ not _ much _ going _ on _ in _ her _ head _
she _ 's _ thinking _ of _ dad _
and _ the _ little _ girl _ is _ saying _
do _ n't _ tell _ mom _
the _ conflict _ 's _ in _ whereas E the E what _ she _ 's _ thinking _ whereas _ she _ did _ n't _ know _ the _ kids _ are _ behind _ her _
and _ did _ i _ say _
the _ cabinet _ doors _ are E n't E the E same E are _ different _ sizes _
have _ no _ handles _
i _ guess _ you _ take _ a _ big _ sledge _ hammer _ to _ that _
well _ the E uh _ the _ little _ boy _ is _
he _ 's _ uh _ partially _ gonna _ fall _ off _ the _ stool _
his _ sister _ is _ telling _ him _ to _ be _ quiet _
the _ mother _ is _ washing _ dishes _
and _ uh _ the _ water _ is _ overflowing _ onto _ the _ floor _ and _ she _ 's _ standing _ in _ a _ puddle _ and _
well _ the _ sink _ is _ running _ over _
she _ 's _ drying _ the _ dishes _
they _ 're _ getting _ in _ the _ cookie _ jar _ and _ they _ 're _ upsetting _ the _ stool _
the _ girl _ is _ reaching _ for _ a _ cookie _
the _ lady _ here _ 's _ standing _ right _ in _ the _ water _
she _ seems _ to _ be _ looking _ out _ the _ window _ at _ the _ lawn _
that _ 's _ about _ it _ right _
i _ s _ see _ this _ woman _ who _ 's _ standing _ by _ the _ sink _ washing _ dishes _ and _ the _ water _ 's _ spilling _ out _ over _ the _ sink _
and _ i _ see _ a E little E this _ little _ boy _ standing _ on _ a _ stool _ reaching _ for _ cookies _ and _ he _ looks _ like _ he _ 's _ ready _ to _ fall _
uh _ as _ far _ as _ action _ goes _ i _ do _ n't _ know _ if _ i _ see _ any _ more _ action _ in _ there _ at _ all _
it _ 's _ a _ family _ affair _ a _ mother _ and _ the _ children _
and _ uh _ they _ 're _ each _ busy _ at E at _ uh _ something _
and _ the _ um _
but _ they _ seem _ happy _ in _ doing _ their _ own _ thing _
i _ do _ n't _ think _ i E i _ lost _ that _
i _ think _ i _
well _ the _ little _ girl _ is _ reaching _ for _ a _ cookie _
and _ the _ boy _ is _ on _ a _ stool _ which _ is _ falling _ over _ to _ get _ in E the E cookie E jar E up _ on _ the _ second _ shelf _ of _ the _ cupboard _ with _ the _ door _ open _

there _ 's _ a _ driveway _ or _ it _ looks _ like _ a _ driveway _ outside _
and _ you _ can _ see _ another _ window _ and _ some _ bushes _ out _ there _ and _ the _ tree _
and _ i _ guess _ that E 's E pa _ looks _ like _ a _ part _ of _ the _ garage _ window _ of _ the _ garage _ out _ there _
and _ uh _ um _ the _ cookie _ jar _ has _ the _ lid _ off _
and _ the _ boy _ has _ one _ hand _ in _ the _ cookie _ jar _ and _ one _ with _ a _ cookie _ in _ it _ handing _ uh _ to _ the _ little _ girl _ who _ 's _ got _ her _ hand _ up _ for _ it _ and _ her E she _ looks _ like _ got _ her _ finger _ to _ mouth _ tell _ him _ to _ be _ careful _

and _ he _ 's _ on _ a _ stool _ and _ it _ 's _ turning _ over _
and _ he _ 's _ handing _ her _ some _ cookies _
and _ in _ the _ second _ picture _ the _ little _ girl _ uh _ looks _ as _ though _ she _ 's _ drying _ dishes _

she _ has _ the _ spigots _ on _
a _ nice _ view _ from _ the _ window _
is E that E is _ that _ it _
that _ 's _ it _

and _ the _ little _ girl _ is _ putting _ her _ finger _ to _ her _ mouth _ that _ she _ 's _ uh _ to _ keep _ it _ quiet _
the _ uh _ mother _ is _ washing _ dishes _

mother _ is _ uh _ holding _ a _ dish _ cloth _ that _ she _ 's _ drying _ the _ dishes _ with _

this _ little _ boy _ might _ fall _ off _ of _ that _ stool _ he _ 's _ on _
and _ the _ water _ 's _ splashing _ out _ all _ over _ the _ floor _ and _ she _ does _ n't _ know _ it _
and _ the E boy E might E he _ 's _ looking _ for _ the _ cookie _ jar _ and _ he _ might _ bang _ his _ head _ on _ the _
uh _ the _ boy _ is _ reaching _ into _ the _ cookie _ jar _

uh _ they _ 're _ nicely _ dressed _ kids _ but _ uh _ the _ boy _ needs _ his _ socks _ pulled _ up _

the _ water _ is _ r E running _ over _ out _ of _ sink _
she _ 's _ drying _ a _ dish _
she _ 's _ looking _ out _ the _ window _
there _ are _ two _ cups _ and _ a _ dish _ i _ presume _ that _ 's _ a _ dish _ that _ are _ already _ dry _ i _ guess _ and _ sitting _ on _ the _ side _ of _ the _ sink _
uh _ nicely _ groomed _
nice _ curtains _ pulled _ back _
it _ 's _ apparently _ summer _ outside _ because _ the _ window _ 's _ open _ and _ it _ looks _ like _ shrubs _ are _ growing _
you _ can _ see _ a _ window _ in _ the _ other _ part _ of _ the _ house _
i _ presume _ that _ 's _ still _ their _ house _
and _ there _ 's _ a _ driveway _ bordered _ with _ grass _
and _ there _ 's _ a _ tree _ out _ there _ somewhere _ that _ you _ can _ see _ part _ of _ the _ trunk _ and _ part _ of _ the _ foliage _
and _ uh _ i _ see _ cabinets _ around _ the _ kitchen _ other _ cabinets _
and _ that _ 's _ about _ it _
oh _ little _ boy _ 's _ in _ the _ cookie _ jar _
the _ girl _ 's _ standing _ down _ and _ waiting _ for _ him _ to _ give E him E some E give _ her _ some _
the _ mother _ 's _ doing _ the _ dishes _

no _
the _ little _ girl _ was _ helping _ the _ boy _ to _ get _ to _ the _ cookie _ jar _
but _ he _ started _ stumbling _
he _ must _ have _ fell _ over _ because _ he _ seems _ to _ be _ falling _ there _
and _ the _ mother _ 's _ over _ at _ the _ sink _ drying _ dishes _
and _ it _ 's _ going _ on _ the _ floor _
and _ three E cups E three _ bowls _ there _
mhm _
the _ little _ boy _ is _ reaching _ for _ a _ cookie _
and _ he _ 's _ falling _ at _ the _ same _ time _ because _ the _ stool _ has _ tipped _ over _
his _ little _ sister _ is _ reaching _ for _ a _ cookie _ and _ i _ think _ beginning _ to _ laugh _ because _ he _ 's _ falling _
the _ sink _ is _ running _ over _ and _ dripping _ water _ on _ the _ floor _ while _ the _ mother _ is _ trying _ to _ dry _ the _ dishes _
um _ the _ window _ is _ open _ and _ the _ curtains _ are _ blowing _ in _ the _ breeze _ coming _ in _ from _ outside _
the _ water _ is _ running _ in _ the _ sink _
that _ 's _ why _ it _ 's _ overflowing _
i _ also _ believe _ that _ the _ mother _ is _ daydreaming _
possibly _ worrying _ about _ uh _ something _
that _ 's _ it _
that _ 's _ all _ i _ see _
hm _
it _ 's _ a _ little _ boy _ climbing _ up _ getting _ some _ coo _ cookies _ out _ of _ the _ cookie _ jar _
and _ his _ little _ sister _ reaching _ for _ some _
and _ the _ little _ boy _ is _ standing _ on _ a _ ladder _
and _ his _ big _ sister _ washing _ the _ dishes _ at _ the _ sink _
big _ sister _ washing _ the _ dishes _ and _ then _ she E got E she _ got _ uh _ dishes _ on _ the _ s _ sitting _ on _ the _ sink _

uh _ the _ water _ is _ still _ running _ in _ the _ sink _
and _ splashing _ on _ the _ floor _
well _ the _ mother _ has _ water _ spilling _ all _ over _ the _ floor _ for _ one _ thing _
then _ she _ 's _ starting _ to _ dry _ the _ dishes _
and _ then _ she _ 's _ looking _ out _ the _ window _
and _ uh _ the _ little _ girl _ 's _ there _ and _ the _ little _ boy _ and _ he _ almost _ is _ falling _ off _ the _ stool _
but _ he _ did _ n't _ so _

and _ sh _ she _ 's _ standing _ there _
it _ 's _ falling _ on _ the _ floor _
the _ child _ is _ got _ a _ stool _ and _ reaching _ up _ into _ the _ cookie _ jar _

and _ she _ 's _ reaching _ up _ to _ get _ it _ but _ i _ do _ n't _ see _ anything _ wrong _ with _ her _ though _
yeah _ that _ 's _ it _
i _ ca _ n't _ see _ anything _

and _ the _ sink _ is _ running _ over _ with _ water _ for _ some _ reason _ or _ other _ while _ she _ 's _ drying _
and _ the _ race _ horse _ is _ jumping _ through _ the _ window _
no _
okay _
anywhere _
um _ the _ little _ girl _ 's _ laughing _
the _ little _ boy _ 's _ getting _ cookies _ and _ he _ 's _ falling _
uh _ i _ guess _ the _ mother _ would _ be _ doing _ dishes _ and _ the _ water _ 's _ overflowing _ out _ of _ the _ sink _
uh _ the _ window _ 's _ open _ and _ i _ would _ say _ the _ wind _ is _ blowing _
i _ guess _ that _ 's _ it _
you _ mean _ like _ the _ woman _ doing _ the _ dishes _ and _ the _ water _ running _ out E of E the E in _ the _ sink _
little _ boy _ is _ getting _ in _ the _ cookie _ jar _
the _ s _ is _ falling _ over _
little _ girl _ wants _ one _

the _ dishes _ sitting _ on _ the _ sink _
and _ the _ window _
the _ grass _ and _ stuff _ outside _
the _ woman _ has _ an _ apron _ on _
i _ do _ n't _ know _ where _ everything _
i _ do _ n't _ see _ anything _ else _ on _ that _
there E 's E um _ the _ two _ children _ are _ in _ the _ process _ of _ stealing _ cookies _ from _ the _ cookie _ jar _
and _ the _ little _ girl _ has _ her _ finger _ up _ to _ her _ mouth _ to _ be _ quiet _
and _ the _ stool _ on _ which _ the _ boy _ is _ standing _ is _ about _ to _ fall _
and _ the _ mother _ must _ be _ looking _ out _ the _ window _ because _ the _ sink _ is _ spilling _ over _ with _ water _ overflowing _ with _ water _
and _ the E meanwhile _ she _ 's _ drying _ the _ dishes _
and _ the _ water _ is _ falling _ down _ onto _ the _ floor _
and _ it _ 's _ a _ nice _ day _
the _ window _ 's _ up _ it _ looks _ like _

she _ 's _ washing _ dishes _ and _ the _ water _ 's _ running _ all _ over _ the _ floor _
and _ the _ boy _ he _ 's _ reaching _ up _ for _ cookies _
and _ he E his _ ladder _ slipped _ from _ underneath _ him _
and _ i _ guess _ he _ 's _ gonna _ have _ an _ accident _
and _ the _ little _ girl _ she _ 's _ waiting _ for _ the _ cookies _ but _ i _ do _ n't _ think _ she _ 's _ gonna _ to _ get _ them _ because _ the _ boy _ 's _ falling _ down _
well _ the _ boy _ is _ getting _ cookies _ and _ he _ 's _ gonna _ fall _ off _ the _ stool _
and _ the _ mother _ is _ doing _ dishes _
and _ the _ water _ is _ running _ over _ out _ of _ the _ sink _
she _ has _ the _ faucet _ on _
she _ 's _ spilling _ water _ all _ over _ the _ floor _

he _ 's _ uh _ taking _ cookies _ out _ of _ the _ cookie E cookie _ jar _
the _ girl _ is _ like _ snickering _ at _ what _ 's _ happening _ to _ him _ in _ a _ sense _
so _ she _ 's _ reaching _ up _ to _ take _ a _ cookie _ from _ his _ hand _
uh _ the E woman E the _ mother _ is _ drying _ a _ dish _
and _ the _ sink _ is _ flooding E over E uh _ overflowing _
and _ there _ 's _ water _ coming _ out _ of _ the _ spigot _
and _ there _ 's _ well _ y _ actually _ happening _ or _ al _
well _ that E 's E that _ 's _ all _ that _ 's _ in _ a _ way _ of _ movement _ but _ there _ 's _ uh _ dishes _ on _ the _ sink _

and _ the _ mother _ of _ the _ house _ is _ washing _ the _ dishes _
and _ the _ water _ is _ overflowing _ from _ the _ sink _ onto _ the _ floor _
and _ the _ uh _ two _ children _ evidently _ a _ brother _ and _ a _ sister _ are _ uh _ getting _ cookies _ out _ of _ the _ cookie _ jar _ which _ is _ on _ the _ second _ shelf _ of _ the _ upper _ cupboard _
and _ uh _ he _ 's _ standing _ on _ a _ three _ legged _ stool _ and _ is _ losing _ its _ balance _ and _ about _ to _ fall _ on _ the _ floor _

and _ the _ lady _ 's _ drying _ a _ plate _
